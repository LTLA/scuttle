#' Downsample a count matrix
#'
#' Downsample a count matrix to a desired proportion, either on a whole-matrix or per-cell basis.
#' 
#' @param x An integer or numeric matrix-like object containing counts.
#' @param prop A numeric scalar or, if \code{bycol=TRUE}, a vector of length \code{ncol(x)}.
#' All values should lie in [0, 1] specifying the downsampling proportion for the matrix or for each cell.
#' @param bycol A logical scalar indicating whether downsampling should be performed on a column-by-column basis.
#' @param sink A \linkS4class{RealizationSink} object specifying the format of the downsampled matrix should be returned.
#' 
#' @return An numeric matrix-like object of downsampled counts.
#' This is usually of the same class as \code{x}, unless \code{sink} is set in which case it is a \linkS4class{DelayedMatrix}.
#' 
#' @details
#' Given multiple batches of very different sequencing depths, 
#' it can be beneficial to downsample the deepest batches to match the coverage of the shallowest batches. 
#' This avoids differences in technical noise that can drive clustering by batch.
#' 
#' If \code{bycol=TRUE}, sampling without replacement is performed on the count vector for each cell.
#' This yields a new count vector where the total is equal to \code{prop} times the original total count. 
#' Each count in the returned matrix is guaranteed to be smaller than the original value in \code{x}.
#' Different proportions can be specified for different cells by setting \code{prop} to a vector;
#' in this manner, downsampling can be used as an alternative to scaling for per-cell normalization.
#' 
#' If \code{bycol=FALSE}, downsampling without replacement is performed on the entire matrix.
#' This yields a new matrix where the total count across all cells is equal to \code{prop} times the original total.
#' The new total count for each cell may not be exactly equal to \code{prop} times the original value,
#' which may or may not be more appropriate than \code{bycol=TRUE} for particular applications.
#' 
#' By default, the output format will be a dense matrix for an ordinary matrix \code{x},
#' and a sparse matrix for any sparse format (i.e., if \code{is_sparse(x)} returns \code{TRUE}).
#' This can be overridden to specify custom formats with \code{sink}, e.g., for HDF5-backed matrices,
#' which may be helpful for dealing with large matrices where the downsampled result may not fit in memory.
#' 
#' Note that this function was originally implemented in the \pkg{scater} package as \code{downsampleCounts},
#' was moved to the \pkg{DropletUtils} package as \code{downsampleMatrix},
#' and finally found a home here.
